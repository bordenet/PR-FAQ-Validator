Press Release

Seattle, WA — August 12, 2025 — Today, FakeCo is pleased to announce the availability of pr-faq-validator, a free tool that helps product managers, business stakeholders, and partners assess the overall effectiveness, completeness, and potential impact of an internal PR-FAQ document before it’s circulated for review.

For the uninitiated, a PR-FAQ is an Amazon-invented product planning mechanism in which the product team writes a press release from the perspective of a future launch date — articulating why the product matters — paired with an FAQ section that anticipates stakeholder questions. This forward-looking narrative forces teams to clarify the customer problem, proposed solution, and the product’s differentiating features before a single line of code is written.

The new pr-faq-validator acts as an objective second set of eyes, flagging common pitfalls such as:
	•	Headlines that bury the real customer value
	•	Overuse of buzzwords without proof
	•	FAQ sections that skip the hard questions (“What happens if this fails?”)
	•	Missing success metrics, customer testimonials, or launch clarity

“Writing a PR-FAQ can be like writing your own wedding vows — you think it’s perfect until someone else reads it,” said Alex Navarro, Senior Principal Product Manager at FakeCo. “pr-faq-validator isn’t here to replace your judgment, but it will save you from that awkward moment when your VP asks, ‘Did you even read this out loud before sending it?’”

“With pr-faq-validator, I can save my colleagues at least an hour or two by passing drafts through this LLM-based tool,” said Jon Williams, Product Manager. “Now, when I do circulate drafts with stakeholders, I have confidence knowing it’s been objectively scored and meets a minimum bar for completeness.”

“Before this tool, my PR-FAQ reviews took so long I was considering growing a beard just to mark the passage of time,” added Priya Shah, Director of Product Innovation at FakeCo. “Now I get pointed, actionable feedback in minutes, and my beard plan is officially on hold.”

pr-faq-validator is available today at no cost, works with standard text-based PR-FAQ files, and requires no signup. Users simply paste in their draft or upload a document, and within seconds receive a report with actionable suggestions for clarity, structure, and impact.

FAQ

Q: Do we intend to charge for this product in the future?
A: No. The validator is free and will remain free. We’re not running a “first hit’s free” business model here.

Q: Are six-pager documents in scope?
A: No — this tool is only good for analyzing internal PR-FAQ documents. For six-pagers, you’re on your own (or you can bribe your teammate with coffee to review it).

Q: Does the tool automatically rewrite my PR-FAQ for me?
A: No. It gives recommendations and examples, but you’ll still have to do the thinking and wordsmithing yourself.

Q: What file formats are supported?
A: Plain text, Markdown, and DOCX are supported. PDF support is “on the roadmap” (a.k.a. someone’s thinking about it in a hallway somewhere).

Q: Will it catch “vision inflation” — where the product starts small but grows into an entire metaverse in the PR-FAQ?
A: It will flag inconsistencies and scope creep in your document. Whether you choose to cut scope or lean into your empire-building dreams is up to you.
